## What are Compound Components?

Compound components are a design pattern commonly used in React to create flexible and declarative UIs. In this pattern, the internal logic of a component is abstracted away, allowing the developer using the component to focus solely on what the UI should look like and how it should behave — which is the core philosophy of React.

Typically, compound components are _unstyled by default_, leaving visual decisions to the user. This pattern empowers developers to compose complex functionality without having to manage the nitty-gritty implementation details.

### A Simple Example: Dropdown

Here’s a basic example of a `Dropdown` component built using the compound components pattern:

```tsx
export function App() {
  return (
    <Dropdown>
      <Dropdown.Trigger>Click Me!</Dropdown.Trigger>
      <Dropdown.Items>
        <Dropdown.Item>John Doe</Dropdown.Item>
        <Dropdown.Item>Susan Storm</Dropdown.Item>
      </Dropdown.Items>
    </Dropdown>
  );
}
```

In the example above:

- `Dropdown` provides the context and manages the state.

- `Dropdown.Trigger` toggles the open/close behavior.

- `Dropdown.Items` conditionally renders the list.

- `Dropdown.Item` represents each individual option.

All the internal behavior — toggling visibility, state management, etc. — is encapsulated within the component. The user simply focuses on structure and content.

If this feels familiar, it’s probably because you’ve seen this pattern in libraries like:

- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/dialog)

- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/react/menu)

### Breaking Down the API

Let’s look at the individual pieces of our Dropdown:

- `<Dropdown>`

  - Acts as the parent container and manages the shared state.

  - Often styled or structured externally by the consumer.

- `<Dropdown.Trigger>`

  - A button or clickable area to toggle the dropdown open or closed.

- `<Dropdown.Items>`

  - Optionally wraps the list of items.

  - Useful for structuring or styling the menu as a group.

- `<Dropdown.Item>`

  - Represents an individual item inside the dropdown list.

### Implementing the Dropdown Component

Let’s see how we can build this using React’s Context and useState:

```tsx
import { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";

const DropdownContext = createContext<{
  open: boolean;
  toggle: () => void;
} | null>(null);

function Dropdown({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
  const toggle = () => setOpen((prev) => !prev);

  return (
    <DropdownContext.Provider value={{ open, toggle }}>
      {children}
    </DropdownContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Trigger({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const context = useContext(DropdownContext);
  if (!context)
    throw new Error("Dropdown.Trigger must be used within <Dropdown>");
  return <button onClick={context.toggle}>{children}</button>;
}

function Items({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const context = useContext(DropdownContext);
  if (!context)
    throw new Error("Dropdown.Items must be used within <Dropdown>");
  return context.open ? <div>{children}</div> : null;
}

function Item({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}

// Attaching subcomponents
Dropdown.Trigger = Trigger;
Dropdown.Items = Items;
Dropdown.Item = Item;

export default Dropdown;
```

### Making It Safer and More Robust

To prevent misuse (e.g., using Dropdown.Trigger outside of Dropdown), we’ve added runtime safety checks using useContext. You can go even further with the following enhancements:

- **_Context Guarding_**

  - Ensure all subcomponents are used within the parent by checking for a valid context.

- **_Type Checking Children (Optional)_**

  - You can validate children inside Dropdown.Items to ensure only Dropdown.Item components are rendered:

###

```tsx
function Items({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const context = useContext(DropdownContext);
  if (!context)
    throw new Error("Dropdown.Items must be used within <Dropdown>");

  return context.open ? (
    <div>
      {React.Children.map(children, (child) => {
        if (React.isValidElement(child) && child.type === Item) {
          return child;
        }
        throw new Error(
          "Dropdown.Items children must be of type <Dropdown.Item>"
        );
      })}
    </div>
  ) : null;
}
```

### Wrapping Up

This implementation is intentionally minimal, but it's a solid foundation. You can extend it to:

- Support keyboard navigation and accessibility (ARIA attributes).

- Add animation for the open/close behavior.

- Style it with Tailwind, CSS-in-JS, or any method of your choice.

Compound components offer a powerful way to build expressive APIs in React — cleanly separating concerns and enabling better code reuse. Hopefully, I’ve convinced you to try this pattern in your next UI project!
